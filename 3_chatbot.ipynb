            "*   **Definition:**  \"State\" refers to the data that describes the condition of a system (like a program or a component) at a particular point in time. It's essentially the memory of what has happened so far.\n",
            "*   **Why is it important?**  State allows a system to remember previous interactions, decisions, or calculations. Without state, a system would be like a goldfish, forgetting everything it just did.\n",

            "\n",

            "\n",
            "1.  **Chains:**  Chains are sequences of calls to components (like LLMs, prompts, retrievers, etc.).  State helps pass information between these components and maintain context.\n",

            "\n",
            "*   **Input Variables:**  Chains receive input variables, which can be considered part of the initial state. For example, a chain might take a `query` as input.\n",
            "*   **Output Variables:**  Chains produce output variables. These outputs can become part of the state for subsequent steps in the chain.\n",
            "*   **Memory:**  Crucially, LangChain provides \"Memory\" components.  These are specifically designed to *persist* information across multiple calls to a chain or agent.  Memory is a way to explicitly manage and update the state.  Think of it as the chain's long-term memory.  Common types of memory include:\n",
